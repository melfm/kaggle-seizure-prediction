# Melbourne University AES/MathWorks/NIH Seizure Prediction

Neural network solution using tensorflow. Three architectures explored, MLP, CNN and RNN.

## Dependencies:
- Tensorflow
- numpy
- Scikit-learn (optional)
- Matlab (to run scripts to pre-process the data)

## Usage:
- Expects the data under the dir: data_dir/Kaggle_data. This includes sample_submission and train_and_test_data_labels_safe (which was used to throw away *bad* data).


Tested on Ubuntu 14.04, tensorflow 0.11.0rc1, GPU:TitanX.
